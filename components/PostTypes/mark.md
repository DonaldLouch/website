The television series “Scorpion” follows a team of geniuses as they are tasked with complex problems that can only be solved by the team. The team is led by Walter O'Brien, one of the smartest people with a high IQ (he states that it’s higher than Albert Einstein). The team also consist of Paige Dineen, a down to earth person with superior communication skills. Toby Curtis (DOC) who is a trained and licensed phycologist and doctor hence his nickname “DOC”. Happy Quinn a smart and talented Mechanical Prodigy. Sylvester Dodd (SLY) a mathematical genius that is always calculating the odds. Cabe Gallo (Gallo) a Homeland security personnel and the lead contact for team Scorpion. The team also has Ralph Dineen on the team a very intelligent middle school student that is taking college classes. Everyone on the team expect for Paige and Gallo have a lower EQ (Emotional Intelligence) and aren’t the greatest at communicating with others. This is where Paige steps in and communicates for her team. I would say that Scorpion shares similar show elements from The Big Bang Theory (the use of intelligent) and any cop or medial mystery television series that have a new case to solve every episode. The show is target towards a male audience ages 25 to 35 years old based on the content of the shows content and ads that are placed within the show.

In past seasons, we’ve seen a significant development with these characters and has since, established the characters which leads to very little character development in the episodes that I have sampled.

I’ll be selecting from a sample of five episodes from the third season which are episodes 13 titled “Faux Money Maux Problems”, episode 14 titled “The Hole Truth”, episode 15 titled “Sharknerdo”, episode 16 titled “Keep It in Check, Mate”, and episode 17 titled “Dirty Seeds, Dirt Cheap”.

The production value and elements within these episodes were consistent and consisted of your typical steady camera movements, basic editing and had a yellow/orange filter to it to give it that “California” vibe. The lower thirds and show banners had a coding theme with elements like and . Like most shows, when a dramatic moment would happen the production team would play dramatic music and sound effects to draw the audience in and to alert them that something is about to happen. I did notice that they don’t clean their set and I noticed dust on the team’s keyboards, on the monitors, and just all around.

Apart from the production elements the show has a strong cast and team up and make a wonderful group of geniuses in their own individual ways.

The team uses certain chemicals to create concert, to wake people up from Comas, and to create a soft-landing pad. The team can create anything out of anything. The team can create a bomb out of flames, wine and cloth. Team Scorpion can fake a death and make it seem legitimate and true. Happy made an acoustic gun so that she and the team could locate lost treasure.

In an episode, a group of counterfeiters called Norteguaian kidnapped team Scorpion and made them create a machine in which would accelerate the operation as team Scorpion has the knowledge of mechanics. However, Norteguaian under estimated the team and the team used the machine to escape. The team further found all the previous money that was counterfeited and burned it and Norteguain were arrested.

In another episode, the team went to a Sandhog and helped them with trying to prevent a sinkhole. However, they didn’t have any success and a sinkhole was created. There was a Salo filled with harsh chemicals in which the team tried to empty before the sinkhole got to it. But was unsuccessful and began to tip over. However, there was a worker on top of the Salo so the team created a method to keep the Salo stable and to get the worker off from the top. After some improvising they could get the worker down. However, it meant that the Salo would be fully tipped over and the chemicals would be released in the sinkhole and to a water main and effect the water. Team Scorpion used these chemicals and some other ingredients to create cement and in doing so, stopped the chemicals from entering the water stream. With this cement, it was a perfect opportunity to fake a death of Veronica so that she could run away from people that she’s owes a lot of money to. The team made the death look realistic and the people she was running away from bought it and believed the death.

In another episode, team Scorpion was hired to find lost treasure. The team used an acoustic gun to locate the treasure by finding frequencies. However, there was technical disturbance that was causing issues and Walter and Paige unfortunately figured this out and in doing so, had to jump ship as the boat was going to explode. Thankfully, Walter clued in on time and got them both off safely.

In another episode, Walter and SLY, were tasked with competing in a chess competition in order to slip a code word to Natalya, a spy and chess master in order to save her life. While, the Walter and SLY attempted to give her the code word, the rest of the team created a plan on how they were going to get her out. The plan consisted of her going to the women’s bathroom, then go through a hole in the wall which leads to the men’s bathroom, which is where they were going to jump out a window and fall into a garbage bin filled with chemically made cushions to soften the landing. Once she was in the garbage bin DOC would come by with a garbage truck in which he stole from the local lot and take the garbage bin to swear drain and then from there the team and Natalya would escape the country. While this was happening, Happy stayed behind and planned a way in which she could break her dad, Patrick out of jail before he got arrested. However, Patrick did the right thing and didn’t go through with the plan and went through the process of being arrested. The plan that Happy thought of was to cut power to the security doors and to the webcams and her dad would run out the door and there would be a set of keys to un-cuff himself.

In another episode, team Scorpion goes on a mission to a doomsday shelter and Greenland. They’re tasked with getting the power back on. They find the power box and turn on the power. However, as soon as they do that they start the air system in which releases a toxin. This toxin makes the team see their worst fears and will put them in a coma then later death. Gallo, Happy, and SLY where the only ones that were exposed to the toxin so it was up to the rest of the team to get the team out of these hallucinations and prevent them from slipping into a coma. In order for, them to get over their hallucinations, Gallo, Happy, and SLY must concur their fears! Therefore, they need the rest of the team to say the right things to get them out. Unfortunately, the team wasn’t quick enough and Gallo, Happy, and SLY slipped into a coma. Walter and Paige went into a storage room and created this chemical solution that would wake the others up. However, they needed to run through the toxins. So, Walter and Paige created breathing tubs out of PVC piping and taking in as much fresh oxygen as possible. This method worked and they could get to the room and create the solution which worked and woke up Gallo, Happy, and SLY.

SLY, is currently running to become the mayor of West Altadena. His campaign methods are completely different then your usual campaign and in doing so, it’s not getting much votes. However, with showing his true self and showing what his role is and what he can do in team Scorpion he’s starting to show people he would be a good mayor. In addition, he’s getting votes from the people who hires the team because they see how much of a good person he is. Furthermore, after seeing his skills in episode 15 from season 3, a local newspaper indorses him.

It doesn’t matter if your intelligent or not. If you’re looking for a show that shows problem solving and a show with a phenomenal cast that plays off each other, Scorpion is the show for you. I would recommend this series to anyone no matter your age. It’s a fun-loving show, has good story lines, well produced, and above all, makes you fall in love with the cast. Scorpion is a team with geniuses with their own skills and areas of wonderful application.

### Plot Description

Team Scorpion is drugged and kidnapped by a counterfeit ring called Norteguaian. These kidnappers are making counterfeit money and are very intelligent. However, they need a more efficient way of producing the money, so they kidnapped team Scorpion.

Team Scorpion need to create a diversion to escape, so Paige and her mother, Veronica, go to a separate room and create a diversion of faking a fight which leads to a “heart attack”. While Paige and Veronica are doing that, Walter, Gallo and SLY work on creating a hole in the wall so they can escape using the counterfeit printer as a drill. Once they get out, they are chased by dogs. Paige and Veronica also escape with Gallo shooting at the counterfeiters and them driving away.

Once they escaped, we got a look at what Happy and DOC were doing. which is planning the wedding and tasting wines. Happy and DOC were wine tasting to see which wine they were wanting for their wedding. While, unknown to them, a main followed behind. They quickly caught on to the man the kidnappers had following them and barely got away after throwing a homemade bomb made from flames, wine, and cloth.

Once the team escaped, they found out that they were hiding the counterfeit money and it was in a vault with real money which would be distributed to banks. Therefore, you wouldn’t know if you were getting real or fake money. The team set the money on fire and burnt it all. In addition, the counterfeiters/kidnappers got arrested by Homeland.

The team all meet back up at the garage. Once they were there they left to go home for the night and for Happy and DOC, they started to discuss their financial situation and found out that they’re both broke and have no money for a big wedding.

Paige Dineen is in her early adulthood. She is clean dressed in a level of comfort. Paige is a people person, she’s good with talking with people and communicating, making her the main communicator for team Scorpion. She is Ralph Dineen’s mom and daughter to Veronica Dineen.

There was a “young” Paige (flashback) at the start of the episode.

### Questions Left

There were no questions that were brought forth from this episode.

### Production Elements

I noticed that the lower thirds and introduction followed a coding theme with elements. The editors of this show used a warmer filter to add some “light hardness” to the show. During dramatic moments, I found that they used dramatic music and sound effects. I noticed that there was a lot of dust on things like the keyboard in the garage.

### Category

I would say this show would be categorised under the “Action” category with slight comedy and realness. In addition, it can further be educational.

### Plot Description

In this week’s episode, Walter walked in the scene with a black eye on the right eye. He had an argument with the Froyo worker about a loyalty stamp card. Walter did end up by getting banned from the establishment. According to DOC and Happy, he’s been banned from several other establishments due him having a low EQ and arguing and disputing with the clerks and employees. Walter needs Paige to help keep him calm and to boost his EQ. However, Paige wants Walter to do it on his own.

The team then heads to a Sandhog to help find where a water leak may be. During this time, though, the team is in danger due to a potential sink hole due to pressure. Unfortunately, the pressure increases and explodes and the water tunnels caves in. However, there is a Salol that’s near the water tunnel which is filled with chemicals that could be very bad if it enters the nearby water stream. The team must do their best in getting the chemicals out of the Salol. However, during this process the Salol begins to fall over. However, one of the construction workers was on top of the Salol. Walter and the chief of the Sandhog had an argument and Happy and DOC had to step in to defuse the situation. However, they couldn’t do it in time and the chief punched Walter in the left eye. Now making Walter have two black eyes. But after the argument they worked together and could get the construction worker back to safety although, the worker did break his leg up on the Salol.

Paige and Veronica, headed to the warehouse that they were in a few episodes ago, their intent is to take the money that Veronica hid. However, there is a significant amount of construction workers along with security personal. Paige and Veronica need to create fake ID’s to pass off as inspectors and shut down the site. In the end, their plan worked and Paige and Veronica got the money.

After Paige and Veronica were done, they heard about the sink hole and went to meet up with the rest of the team.

With the Salol being tipped over the team sadly couldn’t empty the chemicals in time. However, as team Scorpion is filled with genius they could create concreate from the chemicals and other ingredients. Mid way between the concreate hardening Veronica miss stepped and fell down the sink hole and “died”.

It was later revealed that this death was faked and staged, Veronica is very much alive and well!

She did this so she could run away from these men who were after her because she owed them money. So, this death was used as a way for Veronica to create a new identity and leave town and to never be seen.

### Character Development

**Walter O'Brien**

Walter is getting more insensitive and not thinking properly. He’s lashing out, acting out, and “fighting the wrong fight”. He’s become very sensitive. His EQ is rather low.

**Paige Dineen**

Paige became very “emotional” in this episode.

**Toby “DOC” Curtis**

DOC becomes more like Paige and tries to calm down the team and communicate for the team. It didn’t work out very well.

**Happy Quinn**

Happy also became more like Paige and calmed down the team and communicated on behalf of the team.

**Sylvester “SLY” Dodd**

_No Character Development_

**Cabe Gallo**

_No Character Development_

**Ralph Dineen**

_No Character Development_

**Veronica Dineen**

This is the last episode that we’ll be seeing Veronica. Veronica “died” in the sink hole. But in actual reality she faked her own death to escape. At the end of the episode, she exits the garage and left the show.

**Sandhog Chief**

The Sandhog Chief cares for his team and is slightly overconfident about his methods of dealing with issues.

### Questions Left

I would say one question that I have. Why, would they “kill” off Veronica the way they did?

### Production Elements

One thing that I realized for the first time since I’ve started to watch this show (all three seasons) is that Happy says “NOT GOOD!” before the second commercial break. There was a random jump before the final commercial break and the producers later explained the jump with a flashback. During the flashback, they gave the film a more warm/sepia filter.

### Category

Just like the previous episode there was action in this episode and was the main category of the episode.

### Plot Description

Walter makes the discussion that the team will go on a different mission then which was originally planned which would’ve paid well. However, Walter and the team took on the mission of a being pirates and searching for lost treasure which they were promised to be given part of the treasure as payment. Paige was not happy with this discussion and was irritated with Walter.

SLY stayed behind as he was going to be doing an interview with a student reporter to get their endorsement for his campaign for the election.

When the team was on the sea and searching for the treasure they used an acoustic gun to locate it. However, there was a technical disturbance which caused issues and lead to the team not being able to locate the treasure. Walter and Paige went on a separate boat to figure out the issue. Sadly, the problem was within the boat that Walter and Paige were on which lead to an explosion of the boat. They didn’t find this out until they were drifted from the rest of the team. However, Walter was able to figure out that the boat was about to explode so he got himself and Paige off safely. However, during this process their coms fell out of their ears and they didn’t have a way to get back to the team.

After the boat exploded the rest of the team was able to locate the treasure. However, some time went by and the rest of the team tried to get a hold of both Walter and Paige and had no success. Therefore, the team went out to find them. However, Anika the person that hired the team, refused to leave the treasure and look for Walter and Paige.

In the meantime, SLY and the student reporter were in the middle of the interview. When SLY found out that Walter and Paige were missing, he stopped the interview and went ahead and started to help the rest of the team to locate them while the reporter observed.

Meanwhile, Walter and Paige made a make-shift water raft and began to argue. However, after Walter opened up a little, they started to get along again and talked some things out.

Unfortunately, they ran into a problem when some sharks began to swim around them.

Thankfully, the rest of the team found them quickly and were able to save them in time.

Once they got to the garage, they found out that Anika kept the treasure for herself as they left her there.

In addition, they found out that the student reporter gave SLY the endorsement.

### Questions Left

After this episode, I wondered what would’ve happened differently if they had gone with the other job?

### Production Elements

This episode had a higher contrast than normal and didn’t have the warm filter to it. I did find this episode to be on the boring side as it seemed to go very slow and the storyline was a little weak compared to previous weeks.

### Plot Description

The main point of this episode was for Walter and SLY to enter a chess competition in order to protect and free Natalya, a spy and chess master. Natalya was in danger from a bad group from Sardovia that has killed a CIA agent as well as two informants and has a code of names who are in the CIA. This group from Sardovia wants to kill all the people on this list. One of the names on list happened to be Natalya.

For the team to rescue Natalya, that have to secretly tell her the code word(s) “green beans”. To do this, Walter and SLY enter the competition in which Natalya was entered in. Sadly, they were placed in the other bracket and had to win every round against other players to play with Natalya. However, when it came down to it, SLY and Walter are competitive and when facing each other before the last round, they had an argument and messed the board up before it could be vetted. SLY was eliminated and Walter got pushed down the line. The team compromised Natalya’s next opponents’ headset so that the player couldn’t compete, and Walter stepped in and very causally slipped Natalya the code word.

They gave Natalya the code word and threw her out the bathroom window and into a trash container. The team drove the container with a garbage truck, intoa tunnel and successfully escaped.

Gallo, was asked by the FBI to get Patrick, Happy’s dad, to turn himself in and testify against Sunny Duban for an old stolen car ring that happened a long time ago. Happy was not happy about this and thought up a plan to help her dad escape prison. However, in the end Patrick did the right thing and went to jail. You could see that Happy’s heart broke. After a little time, Happy convinced herself that what Gallo did was right and forgave him the best she could.

In this episode, Ralph got asked to a Valentines dance by two girls and went to Walter, SLY, and DOC for advice. This didn’t please Paige as she’s better with this type of thing. However, by the end Ralph did go to Paige for advice.

### Additional Notes

One thing that really annoyed me during this episode was the one banner. This banner displayed just as the “climax” of the episode where there was a translation on screen. The banner blocked the translation and we, the viewers, are left wondering what was said. However, we can kind of assume what happened by the actions that followed.

### Plot Description

In this week’s episode, the Scorpion team travels to Greenland to restore power to a vault which holds food, chemicals, and other doomsday survival items.

When they got there, the team was tasked with restoring the power. They were able to do this, however, as soon as they turned on the power a green toxin flew in the air and was ingested by the team.

Right after, SLY, Gallo, and Happy started to see things and hallucinate. These hallucinations were filled with their deepest fears.

SLY’s fears are that of his past childhood field trip to the petting zoo and being looked in a cage with chickens and having kids bully him. He saw several chickens in the hallucination.

Gallo’s fear is that of growing old and not having the strength to do anything. I think he also fears reality TV shows and gameshows. In his hallucination, he saw himself ageing and growing very weak. But this all happened in a TV show setting. In the gameshow portion Ray, a character from previous seasons, made a guest appearance and was the host of the gameshow.

Happy’s fear is stems from her childhood and when she was in the foster care system and being the only one left and being alone.

Walter, Paige, DOC, and Ralph had to help the rest of the team out of these hallucinations before they went on too long and slip into a coma and then pass away. For SLY, they had to act like bullies and bait him into being confident. For Gallo, they had to remind him of everything that he’s done and how strong he is. Whereas for Happy, DOC, had to sweet talk her and remind her that she’ll be marrying him and that she’s not alone or the last choice.

They may have been able to get them out of the hallucinations but, unfortunately, they were too late and they slipped into a coma. Next, they had to think of a mix of chemicals to wake them up. Walter and Paige had to make it to the room where the chemicals were kept without breathing in the toxic chemicals so they could isolate the air and get proper air via breathing into a PVC pipe and running and then getting more air with the PVC pipe and so on. They made it to the room and then could find chemicals and were able to create enough to wake SLY, Gallo, and Happy. Paige went and gave them the chemicals and Walter stayed to put out a fire that was caused by the chemicals they created.

As Paige, SLY, Gallo, and Happy were escaping, Paige had a hallucination that Walter was kissing some girl. Walter then walked through another door which told Paige that she fears Walter being with other people and that she may just love Walter.

The team rushed back home as SLY had a debate to attend to. During the debate, SLY proved his confidence and, I think, won over some people with his story about what he just endured.

### Additional Notes

I think this is my all-time favorite episode for this show! I love how “real” this was!

</div>, <div>

This assignment has taught me how much I take for granted when watching TV, movies and other content online. I found I struggled with the scheduling and chose this show mainly because this was the only one that fit my schedule the best. Furthermore, I found myself being tired halfway through some of the episodes and there were a few times that I found myself being ready for bed before the episode and then doing the assignment and having full energy after the show and not being able to sleep that night (the sleep before this class). I also, forgot how long commercial breaks are and how many commercials are in an episode. I watched 212 commercials during this assignment.I think after this assignment, I’m going to stick to watching this show online!

One further observation that I’ve noticed is that the only product placement that I’ve seen on this show is for the Microsoft Surface Book. The first season and half they would display the product multiple times in an episode. However, nowadays they rarely show the tablet.
