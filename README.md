# Donald Louch

Hi, my name is Donald and Iâ€™m a twenty-something-year-old Canadian web developer and digital content creator. I was born and raised in Victoria, BC and now reside in Nanaimo, BC.

## Next(Addition)

I have created a multitude of websites (since 2013). I've mainly created them via. Content Management System (CMS) sites such as Weebly and Wordpress. I have for the past five years transitioned and started to develop websites in HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP Procedural language to a PHP OPP (Object-Oriented Programming) language. To now coding in TypeScript and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) ðŸŽ‰

With this new era, I'm able to create a higher-level website and even deploy it on a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) server.

Even though I'm still optimizing and constructing features, I feel as, my website is loading faster and smoother!

## Website Note:

Please note that the website is still in a beta/construction phase. With this, all features will not be fully created and optimized and will be in a more functional state at a later time.

With in saying that, I have constructed the website enough to where you'll be able to visit the website and get updates on myself and view my content!

If you would like you may proceed to the beta version of the website by going to the link: [donaldlouch.ca](https://donaldlouch.ca) or you may go to the alpha version where features are not as develop at [beta.donaldlouch.ca](https://beta.donaldlouch.ca) or my Vercel link [donaldlouch.vercel.app](https://donaldlouch.vercel.app). Or if you would like you may visit the legacy version at [legacy.donaldlouch.ca](https://legacy.donaldlouch.ca)
