# Donald Louch

Hi, my name is Donald and Iâ€™m a twenty-something-year-old Canadian web developer and digital content creator. I was born and raised in Victoria, BC and now reside in Nanaimo, BC.

## Next(Addition)

Since 2013 I have been **maintaining my website and portfolio** and changing the content and its technologies. The website has been powered by **Content Management Systems** such as **Webs, Weebly, SquareSpace, WordPress**, and other CMSâ€™ to then in 2017 I transitioned the website and **hand-coded my own CMS** for the website with **HTML, CSS, and PHP OPP** (Object-Oriented Programming) languages. 

Then today in 2022, Iâ€™m proud to announce that I have changed the website and the CMS to be hand-coded in the **new modern JavaScript Framework of NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** with a codebase of **React** and **TypeScript** ðŸŽ‰.

With this new era, I'm able to create a higher-level website and even deploy it on a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) server. This change has allowed me to have a **faster, smoother, more optimized website and portfolio**, better templating, and so much more!

Even though I'm still optimizing and constructing features, I feel as, my website is loading faster and smoother!

## Website Note:

Please note that the website is still in a beta/construction phase. With this, all features will not be fully created and optimized and will be in a more functional state at a later time.

With in saying that, I have constructed the website enough to where you'll be able to visit the website and get updates on myself and view my content!

If you would like you may proceed to the beta version of the website by going to the link: [donaldlouch.ca](https://donaldlouch.ca) or you may go to the alpha version where features are not as develop at [beta.donaldlouch.ca](https://beta.donaldlouch.ca) or my Vercel link [donaldlouch.vercel.app](https://donaldlouch.vercel.app). Or if you would like you may visit the legacy version at [legacy.donaldlouch.ca](https://legacy.donaldlouch.ca).
