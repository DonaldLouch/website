Hello, my name is Donald Louch, Iâ€™m a Canadian digital producer specializing in web development, photography, videography, and more. I was born and raised in Victoria, BC, Canada (December 3rd, 1994) and moved up to Nanaimo in September of 2015. I attended and graduated (2013-2015) in the Digital Communication, as well as, the Digital Productions Writing and Design certificate programs at Camosun College. I further, attended and graduated (2016-2020) from Vancouver Island University with a Bachelors of Art with a major in Digital Media Studies.

## Next(Addition)

Since 2013 I have been **maintaining my website and portfolio** and changing the content and its technologies. The website has been powered by **Content Management Systems** such as **Webs**, **Weebly**, **SquareSpace**, **WordPress**, and other CMSâ€™ to then in 2017 I transitioned the website and **hand-coded my own CMS** for the website with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **PHP OPP** (Object-Oriented Programming) languages. 

Then today in 2022, Iâ€™m proud to announce that I have changed the website and the CMS to be hand-coded in the **new modern JavaScript Framework of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)** with a codebase of **React** and **TypeScript** ðŸŽ‰.

With this new era, I'm able to create a higher-level website and even deploy it on a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) server. This change has allowed me to have a **faster, smoother**, **more optimized website** and **portfolio**, better templating, and so much more!

Even though I'm still optimizing and constructing features, I feel as, my website is loading faster and smoother!
