# Donald Louch

Hi, my name is Donald and Iâ€™m a <INSERT AGE HERE> Canadian web developer and digital content creator. I was born and raised in Victoria, BC and now reside in Nanaimo, BC.

## Next(Addition)

In the past, I have coded my website and portfolio, from services such as Weebly, Webs, SquareSpace, WordPress, and other Content Management Systems (CMS). I then transitioned to coding in PHP Procedural language then to a PHP OPP (Object-Oriented Programming). To the new era and coding in [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) ðŸŽ‰

With this new era, I'm able to create a higher-level website and even deploy it on a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) server.

Even though I'm still optimizing and constructing features, I feel as my website is loading faster and smoother!

## Website Note:

Please note that the website is still in a beta/construction phase. With this, all features will not be fully created and optimized and will be in a more functional state at a later time.

With in saying that, I have constructed the website enough to where you'll be able to visit the website and get updates on myself and view my content!

If you would like you may proceed to the website by going to the link: [beta.donaldlouch.ca](https://beta.donaldlouch.ca) or my Vercel link [donaldlouch.vercel.app](https://donaldlouch.vercel.app)
